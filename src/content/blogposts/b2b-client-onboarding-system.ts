      <h2>How We Transformed Client Onboarding into a Seamless, Scalable System</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Toronto, Canada</p>
      <p>Client onboarding should never feel like a handoff. At Extra Sauce Agency in Toronto, Canada, we built a system that makes every client feel like they've added a high-performance extension to their in-house team. This case study shares the key shifts we made to create happier clients, smoother execution, and long-term retention.</p>
      
      <h3>TL;DR (Quick Summary)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Instant communication through Slack channels</li>
        <li>Crystal-clear expectations and an 8-week roadmap</li>
        <li>Complete project transparency with a real-time Notion portal</li>

      <h3>The Problem with Traditional Client Onboarding</h3>
      <p>Most agencies think onboarding ends after the kickoff call and a PDF checklist. The real issue is lack of intentional infrastructure to make clients feel supported from day one. Common problems include unclear timelines, confusing handoffs, slow response times, and static documentation.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Onboarding is Where Trust Is Won or Lost</h3>
      <p>Early actions either reinforce or erode the promises made during sales. When onboarding feels like a black box, confidence drops and churn risk rises. Our goal: make every client feel like they've added a high-performance extension to their team.</p>
