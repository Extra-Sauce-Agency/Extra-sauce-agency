			<h2>Why Content Is the Antidote to Rising B2B Acquisition Costs</h2>
			<p>Customer acquisition costs (CAC) have spiked dramatically—up nearly 70% in some sectors. Traditional outbound sales and paid ads are getting pricier and less effective. The solution? Strategic, founder-led content that builds trust and shortens the sales cycle.</p>
			<h3>The Problem: Acquisition Costs Are Rising Fast</h3>
			<p>B2B leaders are feeling the squeeze: sales reps work harder for colder leads, cost-per-click is up, and conversions are down. Saturated ad markets, lower attention spans, and increased competition mean you’re spending more for less pipeline.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Sales reps face colder leads</strong></li>
				<li><em>Cost-per-click is rising</em></li>
				<li>More gatekeepers and competition</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Shift: From Outbound-Led to Content-Led</h3>
			<p>Building trust before the first call is now essential. Strategic content—especially when led by the founder—creates a digital footprint that compounds over time. Consistent posting on LinkedIn and repurposing content across channels establishes credibility and rapport, answers objections, and builds an audience that converts.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Establish credibility</li>
				<li>Build rapport with your market</li>
				<li>Answer objections before they’re raised</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>The Solution: Content That Builds a Realm of Influence</h3>
			<p>Forget vanity metrics. Create content systems that nurture trust, spark engagement, fuel outbound response rates, and reduce reliance on ads. After 6 months of consistent founder-led content, you’ll see:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Higher response rates</strong> from outbound SDRs</li>
				<li><strong>Lower CAC</strong> from paid ads</li>
				<li><strong>More inbound inquiries</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Faster sales cycles</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Commitment: 6 Months of Consistency</h3>
			<p>You don’t need a huge team or budget. A system for regular, purposeful founder-led posting is key. Try:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Post from the founder’s account 3–5x a week</li>
				<li>Post 1x a week from the company page</li>
				<li>Repurpose content across short-form video platforms</li>
				<li>Build a warm outbound system targeting recent engagers and a cold audience</li>
			</ol>
