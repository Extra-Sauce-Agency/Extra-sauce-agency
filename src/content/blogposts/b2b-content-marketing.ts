     <h2>Master One Platform Before Expanding: The Key to Thought Leadership Success</h2>
    
     <p><strong>TL;DR (Quick Summary):</strong> Experiment with styles, diversify formats, dominate LinkedIn before expanding, optimize your process, and invest in a founder-led video series for B2B growth.</p>
     <h3>Why Most Founders Struggle With Thought Leadership</h3>
     <p>Many founders have valuable market insights but struggle to translate them into consistent, engaging content online. The biggest mistake? Trying to be everywhere at once. Instead of spreading thin across multiple platforms, focus on mastering one first — scaling becomes much easier, especially in competitive B2B markets.</p>

     <h3>Step 1: Collect High-Value Substance</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Review sales call recordings & emails to find common pain points in your industry.</li>
       <li>Analyze top-performing content for inspiration.</li>
       <li>Engage in local industry and niche discussions to discover trending topics.</li>
       <li>Learn from experts outside your space via books, podcasts, and videos.</li>
     </ul>
     <p><em>Pro tip:</em> Keep a content question log to capture ideas daily.</p>

     <h3>Step 2: Define Your Strategic Narrative</h3>
     <p>Craft a bigger story your buyers already believe in, based on industry shifts rather than only your product. As Andy Raskin explains, a strategic narrative positions your company as the best solution in the context of a broader movement. Align your message with relevant business trends.</p>

     <h3>Step 3: Establish Your Content Pillars</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Your Solution</strong> – How you solve customer problems</li>
       <li><strong>Your Subject Matter Expertise</strong> – Educational insights & predictions for B2B</li>
       <li><strong>Your Organization’s Story</strong> – Culture and behind-the-scenes</li>
       <li><strong>Your Personal Journey</strong> – Lessons & experiences that humanize your brand</li>
     </ul>
     <p>80% of posts should focus on your solution & expertise.</p>

     <h3>Step 4: Test & Iterate with a One-Month Sprint</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>Post in multiple formats — written posts, carousels, videos.</li>
       <li>Experiment with storytelling approaches and tones.</li>
       <li>Track engagement & feedback to see what resonates most with your audience.</li>
     </ol>

     <h3>Step 5: Master One Platform First</h3>
     <p>Burnout, inconsistent messaging, and low engagement come from chasing too many platforms. Instead, pick LinkedIn as your primary platform, refine your storytelling, and optimize distribution before expanding—especially effective for B2B founders.</p>

     <h3>Step 6: Level Up With Founder-Led Video</h3>
     <p>Video builds deeper trust, conveys emotion, and has higher retention rates. A regular founder-led video series on LinkedIn or YouTube can convert passive followers into inbound leads.</p>

     <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
     <p>Storytelling builds trust with the majority of your audience not ready to buy. When they are, your brand is top of mind. You don’t need a massive budget—just authentic stories and a strategic content system.</p>
