      <h2>The B2B Buyer Journey Has Changed—Are You Keeping Up?</h2>
      <p>
        The traditional B2B sales process is no longer as linear or sales-driven as it once was. Buyers are more self-reliant, conducting research on their own terms and consuming content long before ever speaking to a sales rep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>75% of the B2B buying journey is now done independently.</strong> Your company must be visible and influential <strong>before</strong> a prospect is even in-market. Without the right strategic touchpoints, you risk losing deals before they even start.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, how do you ensure your brand stays top of mind throughout this long decision-making process? The answer: <strong>Founder-Led Marketing.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>The Role of Founder-Led Touchpoints in the B2B Buying Process</h3>
      <p>
        Many companies focus on direct outbound sales efforts, but they overlook the <strong>silent majority</strong>—the 95% of prospects who aren’t yet ready to buy but are gathering information, researching options, and assessing credibility.
      </p>
      <h4>What are Founder-Led Touchpoints?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn Thought Leadership</strong> – Regular founder-led content, sharing insights and industry expertise.</li>
        <li><strong>Guest Podcast Appearances & Webinars</strong> – Engaging in industry conversations builds credibility and awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube & Video Content</strong> – Educational, behind-the-scenes, or strategic insights directly from the founder.</li>
        <li><strong>Founder-Led Newsletters</strong> – Direct communication with the audience, nurturing relationships over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong> – Active participation in LinkedIn groups, Reddit forums, and Slack communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Speaking at Conferences & Events</strong> – Establishing a presence as an industry leader in Toronto, Canada, and beyond.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Founder-Led Marketing Outperforms Traditional Outbound Sales Alone</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>83% of CEOs and C-level executives review a potential vendor’s leadership team’s social media presence before buying.</strong></li>
        <li>Buyers spend most of their journey researching independently, consuming content from trusted industry leaders.</li>
        <li>A founder’s voice is seen as more authentic and credible than corporate-branded content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a prospect encounters <strong>consistent, insightful, and engaging</strong> content from a founder before they’re ready to buy, that brand will have a major advantage when the time comes for them to make a purchasing decision.
