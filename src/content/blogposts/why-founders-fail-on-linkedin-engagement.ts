      <h2>Why Posting & Ghosting Is Hurting Your Founder-Led Marketing on LinkedIn</h2>
      <p>Most B2B founders post content on LinkedIn and expect inbound leads to roll in. But visibility alone doesn’t build authority or pipeline. The real secret? Consistent engagement. Founders who comment, debate, and interact with their audience build trust, credibility, and a stronger inbound pipeline.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Engagement Matters More Than Ever</h3>
      <p>Social platforms reward active participation. If you only post and disappear, your content gets deprioritized by the algorithm. Founders need to engage with their ICP, thought leaders, and industry conversations to maximize reach and impact.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Engagement drives visibility</strong>—the more you interact, the more your content is seen.</li>
        <li><em>Build relationships</em>—commenting and sharing insights positions you as an industry expert.</li>
        <li>Consistent engagement leads to higher inbound pipeline and brand authority.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How to Build an Engagement System</h3>
      <p>Don’t spend all day on LinkedIn. Create a simple engagement routine:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend 15 minutes each morning engaging with your network’s posts.</li>
        <li>Reply to comments and join relevant discussions throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Engage with ICPs, thought leaders, and complementary brands to expand your reach.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <p>Founder-led marketing thrives on trust, authority, and engagement. Posting alone isn’t enough—consistent interaction is the key to building relationships and driving inbound leads. Founders who engage are the ones who win mindshare and pipeline.</p>
