     <h2>How to Build a B2B Content Engine Without Immediate ROI Pressure</h2>
     <p>Getting leadership to greenlight a full content program is tough because content compounds over time rather than paying off instantly. The playbook: start small, prove value with early signals, then scale.</p>

     <h3>Phase 1: Minimum Viable Content Strategy</h3>
     <p>Treat content like a pilot. Align on leading indicators and quick wins instead of demanding last-click ROI on day one.</p>
     <h4>Show the Right Leading Indicators</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Engagement from ideal prospects (comments, shares)</li>
       <li>Decision-maker interactions and DMs referencing content</li>
       <li>Gradual lift in inbound intent over time</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Plan Quick Wins</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Pair content with ABM—invite target accounts to a podcast or webinar</li>
       <li>Turn early traction into internal proof points</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Set Up Self-Reported Attribution</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Add “How did you hear about us?” on forms</li>
       <li>Track mentions of posts, podcasts, and webinars</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Phase 2: Answer These Readiness Questions Before You Scale</h3>
     <h4>Investment & Cadence</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Weekly or daily output? Insightful, entertaining, or hybrid?</li>
       <li>What’s the initial production budget?</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Workflow & Infrastructure</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Who runs it—solo marketer, small team, or agency?</li>
       <li>Automation for distribution, SOPs for repeatable tasks</li>
       <li>Right setup for video/podcasting</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Execution & Formats</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Is the founder comfortable on video? Prefer written first?</li>
       <li>Mix short-form + long-form; add visuals (carousels, infographics, GIFs)</li>
       <li>Create natively for each platform’s best UX</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Phase 3: Build Momentum with Founder-Led Content</h3>
     <h4>Make Creation Seamless</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Batch record 1–2 days/month</li>
       <li>Ghostwrite and extract content from internal meetings</li>
       <li>Have a strategist repurpose into multiple formats</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Incentivize Teams</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Sales uses content for prospecting</li>
       <li>Leadership aligns narrative and vision</li>
       <li>Marketing optimizes with audience data</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Track Impact</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>Leads that cite content in self-reported attribution</li>
       <li>Rising engagement, profile visits, inbound requests</li>
       <li>Qualitative wins (exec comments, prospect call-backs)</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
     <p>Storytelling builds trust with the majority of your audience not ready to buy. When they are, your brand is top of mind. You don’t need a massive budget—just authentic stories and a strategic content system.</p>
