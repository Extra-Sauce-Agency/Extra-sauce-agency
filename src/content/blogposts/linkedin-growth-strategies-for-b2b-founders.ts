      <h2>When Founders Say LinkedIn Doesn’t Work: How to Build a Growth Strategy That Delivers</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Toronto, Canada</p>
      <p>Many founders give up on LinkedIn because they don’t see results, despite consistent posting and engagement. The real issue isn’t the platform—it’s the lack of strategic focus and refinement. This blog breaks down how going all-in on LinkedIn as a primary sales channel can drive pipeline growth for B2B founders.</p>
      
      <h3>TL;DR (Quick Summary)</h3>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why LinkedIn Isn’t Working for Most Founders</h3>
      <p>Most founders spread their efforts across too many channels—cold email, events, webinars, DMs, and content. This dilutes focus and makes it hard to see what’s working. The secret is to go deep on LinkedIn, test content formats, and refine your approach until you see traction.</p>
