      <h2>Why the Traditional Social Media Agency Model is Dying in Toronto & Canada</h2>
      <p>The old social media agency model is becoming obsolete in Toronto and across Canada. Posting generic content 20 times a month no longer drives real business results. Brands need strategic, high-value content to stand out and grow.</p>
      
      <h3>TL;DR (Quick Summary)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The old agency model is outdated.</strong> Generic posting doesn't work for Toronto & Canadian businesses anymore.</li>
        <li><em>Surface-level content won't drive revenue.</em> Strategic content is essential for B2B growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Founder-Led Marketing (FLM) is the future.</strong> B2B founders in Toronto & Canada are building pipelines through personal branding.</li>
        <li>Modern agencies focus on building content engines, not just posting.</li>
        <li>B2B content in Toronto & Canada can be entertaining and insightful.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why Most Social Media Agencies Will Disappear in 2024</h3>
      <p>AI tools, automation, and in-house teams have made basic social media management obsolete in Toronto and Canada. Businesses now use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-powered design tools like Canva and Adobe Firefly</li>
        <li>Automated social media schedulers</li>
        <li>Paid ad platforms like Meta and LinkedIn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Traditional agencies offered cookie-cutter solutions, but B2B buyers in Toronto & Canada now self-educate before buying. Content must help them make decisions.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Founder-Led Marketing (FLM) is the Future in Toronto & Canada</h3>
      <p>At Extra Sauce Agency, we saw the shift and pivoted. The biggest opportunity in B2B marketing is helping founders create content that builds inbound revenue in Toronto and Canada.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trust drives buying decisions—people trust experts, not faceless brands.</li>
        <li>B2B buyers want insights, not ads.</li>
        <li>FLM compounds over time, generating leads long after publishing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Founders who post regularly on LinkedIn, run podcasts, and share real insights outperform brands relying on outbound sales and paid ads.</p>
      
      <h3>The New Social Media Agency Model: Content Engines That Drive Revenue</h3>
      <p>Agencies that survive in Toronto & Canada focus on revenue, not just engagement. They help brands:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>Develop high-impact LinkedIn and YouTube content for decision-makers.</li>
        <li>Turn content into lead-generation systems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Example: A SaaS founder in Toronto could host weekly LinkedIn video series, repurpose content into short clips, and educate prospects instead of cold-selling.</p>
