      <h2>My Journey & Where I'm Headed: How Founder-Led Marketing Changed Everything</h2>
      <p>Learn how founder-led marketing transformed a sportswear brand and why it's the secret weapon for B2B SaaS founders seeking trust and inbound growth.</p>
      
      <h3>TL;DR (Quick Summary)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Founder-led content drives engagement and sales—even with zero budget.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Personal storytelling outperforms high-budget campaigns.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>People connect with stories, not just products.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Extra Sauce Agency helps SaaS companies implement founder-led marketing for inbound revenue.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Beginning: No Marketing Budget, No Problem</h3>
      <p>Launching Defiant Regime meant spending every dollar on production, leaving nothing for marketing. Instead of waiting, I became the face of the brand, documenting my journey and sharing behind-the-scenes moments.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticity unlocked powerful engagement.</li>
        <li>Founder presence built brand recognition faster than paid ads.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What Happened Next? My Brand Took Off</h3>
      <p>Views and sales climbed as I shared my story. A $4,000 campaign video performed worse than a simple founder video. Why? Because people buy stories and trust real people.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Increased views and sales</li>
        <li>Stronger brand recognition</li>
        <li>Authentic connection with customers</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Founder-Led Marketing: The Competitive Edge</h3>
      <p>Product differentiation only goes so far. Your vision and story are unique. Founder-led marketing is an unfair advantage, proven by brands like HubSpot, Acquisition.com, VaynerMedia, Kylie Cosmetics, Proper Twelve, and Teremana Tequila.</p>
