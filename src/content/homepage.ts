    },

      question: "Have you worked with SAAS, AI, or the tech space?",
      answer: "Yes—our core focus is B2B tech/SaaS. The Sauce Recipe™ is built for technical buyers, longer sales cycles, and category competition."
    },
    {
      question: "How much content can we expect to come out monthly?",
      answer: "It depends on the service (Executive Engine vs. Brand Show), distribution channels, and quality of content asset. On average, we create about 15-20 content assets/mo. We'll align on a cadence that's sustainable and tied to clear revenue goals."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for a B2B show to generate pipeline?",
      answer: "Most teams start seeing leading indicators within the first 60-90 days (engagement quality, qualified sales opportunities, outbound lift). Revenue impact typically follows as distribution compounds."
    },
    {
      question: "What do you mean by a B2B brand show and how do these bring in revenue?",
      answer: "We create 'diary of a CEO' brand shows that are repeatable, executive-led content series (podcast, webinar, episodic series) engineered to build authority. Revenue happens when the show is connected to distribution + strategic outbound."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes you different from other content or podcast agencies?",
      answer: "We don't just fill the feed with more content - we build a content-led revenue system. That means: narrative + brand show + distribution + outbound alignment + measurement."
    },
    {
      question: "How much work is required from the internal team?",
      answer: "Our system caters to busy executives. We typically only require ~4hrs/mo for executives to show up to record the content. Everything else is handled by us with a white-glove approach."
