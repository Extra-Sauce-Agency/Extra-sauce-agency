      <p>Meet "Remi," the newest member of the Extra Sauce family. This AI-powered content agent helps B2B founders craft authentic, impactful thought leadership content at scale—without sacrificing substance or voice.</p>
      
      <p>Remi is trained by real B2B copywriters and powered by Extra Sauce's proprietary SAUCE Recipe™. It's designed to help founders and executives consistently publish content that sounds like them—technical, strategic, and uniquely human—while driving pipeline and industry authority.</p>
      
      <p>But Remi isn't just another AI tool. It's the result of 18 months of behind-the-scenes research, development, and rigorous testing. Over that time, Extra Sauce has explored various large language models (LLMs), evaluating their ability to support content ideation, research, tonality matching, and workflow efficiency.</p>

        <p>"We don't believe in AI-created content. We believe in AI-powered content. You still need the unique POV, critical thinking, and creativity that only humans can bring. Remi makes that process faster—without compromising quality on these first principles."</p>

      <p>Our agency has already tested our internal AI infrastructures with select clients—yielding powerful results. In just the first 45 days of 2025, one B2B professional services client using our Cassidy AI workflow hit over 1.3 million impressions and booked qualified meetings directly from founder-led content published on LinkedIn.</p>
      
      <h3>What sets Remi apart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Trained using Extra Sauce's proven SAUCE Recipe™ content framework</li>
        <li>Integrates with your company knowledge base to maintain your unique voice and story</li>
        <li>Supports C-level execs and marketers in scaling high-performing thought leadership</li>
        <li>Backed by real content marketetrs through vigorous A/B testing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Extra Sauce is no stranger to building brand equity through content. We've helped leading media companies like Goalcast grow their audience and revenue, and worked with DTC brands across supplements, F&B, and lifestyle—learning what truly stops the scroll. Now, we're bringing those high-performing creative insights into the B2B world, where content has lagged behind.</p>
      
      <p>While we're not revealing our entire AI infrastructure just yet, Remi is our first public step into a future where B2B companies can scale influence without losing authenticity. Early access to Remi will open soon to qualified users via a waitlist program.</p>
