      <p>Extra Sauce unveils its proprietary SAUCE Recipe™—a battle-tested framework engineered to help B2B founders generate qualified leads, shorten sales cycles, and build trust with modern buyers through founder-led content.</p>
      
      <p>The SAUCE Recipe™ is the result of years spent on the frontlines of B2B and consumer content. Designed for busy executives and SaaS founders, the framework distills high-performing storytelling into a repeatable system that aligns with how modern buyers research, evaluate, and decide—on their terms.</p>
      
      <p>Originally built out of necessity by founder Manny Jassal during the early days of growing his direct-to-consumer streetwear brand, the SAUCE Recipe™ has since powered content strategies for some of the world's top media companies and venture-backed startups. Now, it's the centerpiece of Extra Sauce's client delivery engine.</p>

        <p>"Most companies confuse content with noise. The SAUCE Recipe™ gives structure to what makes content work—real stories, sharp insight, and execution that earns attention and drives revenue."</p>
        <footer style="margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">— Manny Jassal, Founder of Extra Sauce</footer>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The release comes at a time when the B2B buyer journey continues to evolve rapidly. Today's decision-makers actively avoid cold outreach and prefer to self-educate through channels like LinkedIn, YouTube, and peer communities. The SAUCE Recipe™ empowers founders to meet them there—consistently and credibly.</p>
      
      <h3>Here's what the SAUCE Recipe™ helps B2B companies achieve:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn founder insights into a weekly engine for demand</li>
        <li>Attract inbound leads without performance ad spend</li>
        <li>Show up as the face of the category—not just a product</li>
        <li>Build pipeline without relying on cold outbound</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The framework is already in use across Extra Sauce's client base, which includes high-growth SaaS and global media brands like Goalcast, PSII, Depix AI, and Sterling Capital. With experience spanning food & beverage, supplements, and tech, the agency has merged the scroll-stopping creativity of DTC with the revenue-minded strategy of B2B—offering clients an edge that most agencies can't replicate.</p>
      
      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">
        <p>"We've helped CEOs and CTOs with no audience build authority, generate leads, and close 400k+ ARR — without a single dollar spent on paid ads. The SAUCE Recipe™ is why. This is our unfair advantage, and now we're sharing it."</p>
