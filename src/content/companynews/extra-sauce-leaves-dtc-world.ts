      <p>Manny Jassal, founder of Extra Sauce Agency, shares how his personal storytelling journey as the face of a streetwear brand became the launchpad for helping SaaS companies scale through founder-led marketing.</p>
      
      <p>In 2020, Manny launched Defiant Regime, a high-quality streetwear brand, with no marketing budget—only a bold vision and a phone camera. Instead of waiting for funding, he became the face of the brand, documenting his journey, product development, and everyday hustle.</p>
      
      <p>The result? A loyal community, a recognizable brand, and sales growth powered entirely by authentic content.</p>
      
      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">
        <p>"I spent $4,000 on a high-end brand video. It didn't come close to the performance of a simple iPhone video of me talking about the brand or product development in our studio."</p>
        <footer style="margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">— Manny Jassal, Founder of Extra Sauce Agency</footer>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>That realization became the foundation for Extra Sauce Agency—launched to help SaaS founders turn their voice, vision, and insight into content that drives inbound pipeline. Manny now leads a growing team helping companies build trust at scale with modern B2B buyers who ignore cold emails and engage with real voices online.</p>
      
      <p>Extra Sauce has worked with some of the biggest media companies in the world, including <strong>Goalcast</strong>, we helped them generate <strong>16M+ views in 5 months, gain over 400K+ followers, and over 100K in revenue from organic content</strong>. Also, we've worked with a wide variety of DTC consumer brands, ranging from supplement companies to food and beverage labels. This cross-industry exposure has helped the agency learn what stops the scroll and engages audiences deeply. Now, Extra Sauce is bringing those <strong>battle-tested DTC content practices</strong> into the B2B world—where content has historically lagged behind in creativity and performance.</p>
      
      <p>The team is excited to inject that same creative energy and storytelling firepower into founder-led B2B content.</p>

        <h3 style="margin: 0; color: white;">Extra Sauce is built to help SaaS founders:</h3>
      </div>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Turn executive insights into a full-funnel content engine</li>
        <li>Generate demand without heavy reliance on ads or outbound</li>
        <li>Position themselves as the go-to expert in their category</li>
        <li>Stand out with story-driven content that converts</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Most B2B companies miss the mark by treating content like PR fluff or delegating strategy to junior marketers. Extra Sauce flips the playbook—bringing founders to the front lines of marketing to create connection, not just awareness.</p>
      
      <p>Since launching, the agency has helped clients reduce CAC, shorten sales cycles, and win deals that once felt out of reach.</p>
      
      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b; padding-left: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic;">
        <p>"Founder-led marketing isn't optional anymore. It's your competitive edge. And it's not about vanity—it's about building trust that scales."</p>

      <p>Extra Sauce is now accepting new SaaS clients looking to build content engines rooted in founder voice and strategic storytelling. The agency has positioned itself at the forefront of a new era in B2B growth—where buyers follow people, not companies.</p>
